### Hi there 👋

I am Jannis, presently pursuing my computer science studies at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt while also serving as a Software Engineer at Software AG in Eberstadt. 📚

During my free hours, I am an integral part of the [Formula Student Racing Team at my university](https://fastda-racing.de), actively contributing to the construction of a Formula Racecar. My responsibilities extend to the development of the electronic system and the driverless concept. Since this past summer, I have taken over the role of Head IT-Administrator, overseeing the management of our internal applications and IT services. 🏎️🧑‍💻🌐

For further insights into my work, I invite you to explore my [portfolio website](https://jg.team) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jangue/). 📥💬
